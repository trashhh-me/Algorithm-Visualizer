Create a loop around visited array and compare with the reachable array of current node to prevent loops. If loop found, just traverse the next reachable node.

Shorten code by putting path cost ips into an array and looping it.

Clean the code, clearing all the redundancies.

If visited.includes(end2) then pop end2 from reachable array 



need to distinguish and separate a function to generate the end 2







Make a generate_pathID function which generates the right subID // will not do this for now, just leave it in path_choose function 


No other way to do this other than removing visited from reachable array

Need to fix wrong items being deleted from the reach_array 
Also to fix S-1-4-3-2-5-G path (why it gets messed up?)
