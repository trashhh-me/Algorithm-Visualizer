                    they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. For

                    Queue Representation:
                    Like stacks, Queues can also be represented in an array: In this representation, the Queue is
                    implemented using the array. Variables used in this case are

                    Queue: the name of the array storing queue elements.
                    Front: the index where the first element is stored in the array representing the queue.
                    Rear: the index where the last element is stored in an array representing the queue.

                <h5 class="card-title">Linear Hashing</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table
                  by using a hash function. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">It is done for faster access to
                    elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.
                    Hashing Components:

                    1) Hash Table: An array that stores pointers to records corresponding to a given phone number. An
                    entry in hash table is NIL if no existing phone number has hash function value equal to the index
                    for the entry. In simple terms, we can say that hash table is a generalization of array. Hash table
                    gives the functionality in which a collection of data is stored in such a way that it is easy to
                    find those items later if required. This makes searching of an element very efficient.

                    2) Hash Function: A function that converts a given big phone number to a small practical integer
                    value. The mapped integer value is used as an index in hash table. So, in simple terms we can say
                    that a hash function is used to transform a given key into a specific slot index. Its main job is to
                    map each and every possible key into a unique slot index. If every key is mapped into a unique slot
                    index, then the hash function is known as a perfect hash function. It is very difficult to create a
                    perfect hash function but our job as a programmer is to create such a hash function with the help of
                    which the number of collisions are as few as possible. Collision is discussed ahead.
